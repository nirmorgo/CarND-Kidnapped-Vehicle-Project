# Overview
This repository contains a C++ implemetation of a 2D particle filter. This is a project from Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

## Running the Code
This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install uWebSocketIO for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu to install uWebSocketIO.

Scripts have been included to streamline the build creation process, by executing the following in the top directory of the project:

1. ./clean.sh
2. ./build.sh
3. ./run.sh

Here is the main protocol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.

### Filter Inputs

// sense noisy position data from the simulator

["sense_x"]

["sense_y"]

["sense_theta"]

// get the previous velocity and yaw rate to predict the particle's transitioned state

["previous_velocity"]

["previous_yawrate"]

// receive noisy observation data from the simulator, in a respective list of x/y values

["sense_observations_x"]

["sense_observations_y"]


### Filter Outputs

// best particle values used for calculating the error evaluation

["best_particle_x"]

["best_particle_y"]

["best_particle_theta"]

//Optional message data used for debugging particle's sensing and associations

// for respective (x,y) sensed positions ID label

["best_particle_associations"]

// for respective (x,y) sensed positions

["best_particle_sense_x"] <= list of sensed x positions

["best_particle_sense_y"] <= list of sensed y positions

# Implementation of the Particle Filter
The directory structure of this repository is as follows:

```
root
|   build.sh
|   clean.sh
|   CMakeLists.txt
|   README.md
|   run.sh

|___data
|   |   
|   |   map_data.txt

    |   helper_functions.h
    |   main.cpp
    |   map.h
    |   particle_filter.cpp
    |   particle_filter.h
```

## Inputs to the Particle Filter
You can find the inputs to the particle filter in the `data` directory.

#### The Map*
`map_data.txt` includes the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Each row has three columns
1. x position
2. y position
3. landmark id

### All other data the simulator provides, such as observations and controls.

> * Map data provided by 3D Mapping Solutions GmbH.

## **Results**
![Screenshot](imgs/final_screen.png)

1. **Accuracy**: The average localization error was (0.113, 0.103, 0.004) which is well below the original GPS sensor error defined as (0.3,0.3,0.01)

2. **Performance**: The implementation is efficient and the total runtime is 48.88 seconds which is more than twice faster than the 100 seconds target that was set.
